[0.00s - 1.60s] Mom, I'm going to take the train.
[1.60s - 2.80s] Wait for me to go home for the New Year.
[4.80s - 6.60s] What can I do here?
[6.60s - 7.60s] Oh, right.
[9.40s - 10.60s] How dare you rob me!
[10.60s - 11.60s] I'll show you!
[12.40s - 14.00s] This ring is on the sky.
[14.00s - 15.60s] It's rare to see a kiss.
[15.60s - 17.00s] I like little fish.
[17.00s - 18.00s] I'll teach you.
[20.00s - 21.20s] Come on.
[21.20s - 23.20s] I'm in the world.
[23.20s - 24.60s] Come on, let's keep robbing.
[26.20s - 28.80s] The G104 train should be here.
[30.00s - 31.60s] Come on, let's keep robbing.
[36.60s - 37.60s] Is there a mistake?
[37.60s - 38.60s] What time is it?
[40.60s - 41.60s] I'm going to save people.
[43.60s - 44.60s] Not me.
[44.60s - 46.60s] Do you know how to save people?
[46.60s - 47.60s] Actually, I...
[50.60s - 51.60s] Don't hang around.
[51.60s - 53.60s] It's a migrant worker.
[53.60s - 55.60s] I'm a native.
[55.60s - 56.60s] That's great.
[56.60s - 57.60s] It's a native.
[57.60s - 58.60s] We're saved.
[60.60s - 62.60s] I'll break your back.
[63.60s - 65.60s] I'll break his back.
[65.60s - 67.60s] I suddenly smiled.
[67.60s - 69.60s] It's a mess.
[69.60s - 71.60s] I'll save you today.
[75.60s - 77.60s] Three, two, one.
[78.60s - 79.60s] What are you doing?
[79.60s - 82.60s] I'm a weightlifting professional.
[82.60s - 83.60s] Why didn't you tell me earlier?
[83.60s - 85.60s] You didn't give me a chance.
[85.60s - 86.60s] Dismissed.
