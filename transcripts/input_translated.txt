 Mom, I'm going to take the train.
 Wait for me to go home for New Year.
 What can I do in the night?
 Oh, right.
 How dare you rob me?
 I'll teach you a lesson.
 This ring is on the sky.
 It's rare to have a kiss in the world.
 I like to be naughty.
 I'll teach you.
 Hurry up.
 I'm in the world.
 Come on, let's go on.
 The G104 train should be here.
 Come on, let's go on.
 Is there a mistake?
 What time is it?
 I'm going to save people.
 Not me.
 Do you know how to save people?
 Actually, I...
 Don't hang around.
 It's a migrant worker.
 I'm a native.
 That's great.
 It's a native.
 We're saved.
 I'll cut off your throat.
 I'll cut off his throat.
 I suddenly smiled.
 It's a mess.
 I'll save you today.
 Three, two, one.
 What are you doing?
 I majored in weightlifting.
 Why didn't you tell me earlier?
 You didn't give me a chance.
 Let's go.
