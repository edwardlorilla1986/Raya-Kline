 Mom, I'm going to take the train.
 Wait for me to go home for the New Year.
 Go.
 What can I do for New Year's Eve?
 Oh, right.
 How dare you rob me in public?
 I'll teach you a lesson.
 This ring is on the sky.
 It's rare to see a kiss.
 I like to be naughty.
 Hurry up.
 I'm in the world.
 Come on, let's go on robbing.
 The G104 train should be here.
 Someone is robbing the bag.
 Is there any mistake?
 What time is it?
 We're going to save people.
 Do you know how to save people?
 In fact, I...
 Bird No. 3 is a migrant worker.
 I'm a native.
 That's great.
 It's a native.
 We're saved.
 I'm going to cut off your back.
 I'm going to cut off his back.
 I suddenly smiled.
 A bunch of people are in a mess.
 I think today
 no one can protect you.
 Three, two, one.
 What are you doing?
 In fact, I'm a weightlifting professional at the PE school.
 Why didn't you tell me earlier?
 You didn't give me a chance.
 All right, I'm out.
