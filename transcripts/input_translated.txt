 Mom, I'm going to take the train.
 Wait for me to go home for the New Year.
 What can I do in my spare time?
 Oh, right.
 How dare you rob me!
 Watch me!
 This ring is on the sky.
 It's rare to see a kiss.
 I like to think about you.
 I want to call you.
 Hurry up!
 I'm in the world.
 Come on, let's keep robbing.
 The G104 train should be here.
 Come on, let's keep robbing.
 Is there a mistake?
 What time is it?
 I'm going to save people.
 Not me.
 Do you know how to save people?
 Actually, I...
 Don't hang around.
 It's a migrant worker.
 I'm a native.
 That's great.
 It's a native.
 We're saved.
 I'm going to break your back.
 I'm going to break his back.
 I suddenly smiled.
 It's a mess.
 I think today
 Who can protect you?
 Three, two, one.
 What are you doing?
 Actually, I'm a weightlifting professional.
 Why didn't you tell me earlier?
 You didn't give me a chance.
 Let's go.
