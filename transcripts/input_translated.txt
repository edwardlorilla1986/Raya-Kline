 Mom, I'm going to take the train.
 Wait for me to go home for the New Year.
 What can I do in my spare time?
 Oh, right.
 How dare you rob me?
 I'll teach you a lesson.
 This ring is in the sky.
 It's rare to see a kiss.
 I like to think about it.
 I'll teach you.
 Hurry up.
 I'm in the world.
 Come on, let's keep robbing.
 The G104 train should be here.
 Someone is robbing my bag.
 Is there a mistake?
 What time is it?
 You're going to save people.
 I'm not the one who said it.
 Will you save people or not?
 Actually, I...
 Bird No. 3.
 It's the migrant worker.
 I'm a native.
 That's great.
 It's the native.
 We're saved.
 I'll cut off your back.
 I'll cut off his back with this air gun.
 I suddenly smiled.
 A bunch of people are in a mess.
 I think today
 who can keep you in the bag?
 Three, two, one.
 What's wrong with you?
 Actually, I'm a weightlifting professional at the PE school.
 Why didn't you say so earlier?
 You didn't give me a chance.
 All right, I'm out.
